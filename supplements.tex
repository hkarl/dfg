\subsection{Data handling}
Data generated during this project will be used for scientific publications in
preprint and peer-reviewed journals. Therefore, all necessary data (such as raw
sequencing data) will be deposited in publicly available repositories
(\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/}{NCBI GEO} and
\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra}{SRA}, \href{https://osf.io/}{OSF}). To
allow complete reproducibility of all analyses, the source code and executed
comands will be also made publicly available
(\href{https://github.com/}{GitHub}).  Thus, all relevant data will become
accessible for future use.
